        <p>Below are the nessecary ingredients and steps to make this meal</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul style="line-height:150%">
            <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs </li>
            <li>3 ounces (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream </li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract </li>
            <li>1/3 cup seedless raspberry jam </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice </li>
            <li>Fresh raspberries, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
       
        <ol style="line-height:200%">
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with waxed paper. </li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, add the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Toss with a fork until evenly moistened. </li>
            <li>Press the mixture over the bottom and 1-inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Refrigerate until ready to use. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl when necessary. </li>
            <li>Beat in the sour cream until blended. </li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan. </li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the jam and lemon juice, stirring until smooth. </li>
            <li>Drizzle 1/4 of the jam mixture in stripes over the batter. </li>
            <li>Spoon the remaining cheesecake batter over the jam, then drizzle with the remaining jam. Swirl gently with a thin knife to marbleize the batter slightly.</li>
            <li>Bake the cheesecake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, until firm around the edges but still slightly wobbly in the center. </li>
            <li>While still in the pan, set the cheesecake on a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap the cake pan in plastic and chill for at least 4 hours. Remove the cake from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. </li>
            <li>Remove the pan sides and place the cake on a serving platter. Garnish with fresh raspberries, serve, and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Grandma's tips:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The raspberry swirl cheesecake can be wrapped well and refrigerated up to 3 days, or frozen up to 3 months.</li>
            <li>If your cheesecake always cracks, try this: Before heating the oven, place a baking pan half-filled with hot tap water on the bottom rack. Bake the cake on the middle rack above the pan and don't peek.</li>
            <li>A cheesecake is done when the edges are slightly puffed and an area the size of a silver dollar in the center is moist and soft. It will firm as the cake cools.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble cutting this raspberry cheesecake, try it with dental floss or fishing line. Simply stretch a length across the top of the cake and, holding it taut, bring it down to the bottom of the cake. Let go of one end and pull the floss out with the other. You may want to do so before guests arrive.</li>
        </ul>
